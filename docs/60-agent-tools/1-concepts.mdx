# ðŸ“˜ Tools, libraries, and concepts

Here is a quick overview of tools, libraries and concepts that you will come across in this section of the lab:

## [datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/en/index)

Library used to download a dataset of Arxiv papers from Hugging Face.

## [ArxivLoader](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/document_loaders/arxiv/)

Document loader class in LangChain that used to load research papers from Arxiv.org as LangChain Document objects.

## [PyMongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

Python driver for MongoDB. Used to connect to MongoDB databases, delete and insert documents into a MongoDB collection.

## LangChain integrations

Standalone `langchain-{provider}` packages for improved versioning, dependency management and testing. You will come across the following in this lab:

* [langchain-mongodb](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/providers/mongodb_atlas/): Used to create a MongoDB Atlas vector store and also to store and retrieve chat message history from MongoDB

* [langchain-huggingface](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/platforms/huggingface/): To access open-source embedding models from HuggingFace

* [langchain-fireworks](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/providers/fireworks/): To use Firework AI's chat completion models

## [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/expression_language/)

LCEL provides a declarative way to chain together prompts, data processing steps, calls to LLMs, and tools. Each unit in a chain is called a Runnable and can be invoked, streamed and transformed on its own.

## [RunnableLambda](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/runnables/langchain_core.runnables.base.RunnableLambda.html)

RunnableLambda converts any arbitrary Python function into a LangChain Runnable.
