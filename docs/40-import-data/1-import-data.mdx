# üëê Import data into MongoDB

The documentation agent has two tools- a vector search tool to retrieve information from documentation to answer questions, and another tool to get the content from specific documentation pages for summarization.

Let's import the data required by these tools into two MongoDB collections. This is as simple as making a `POST` request to a serverless function that we have created for you.

Run the cells under the **Step 2: Import data into MongoDB** section in the notebook to import the data required by the agent's tools, into MongoDB collections.

To verify that the data has been imported into your MongoDB cluster, navigate to the **Overview** page in the Atlas UI. In the **Clusters section**, select your cluster and click **Browse collections**.

Ensure that you see a database called _mongodb_genai_devday_, and two collections namely _mongodb-docs_ and _mongodb-docs-embedded_ under it. Note the number and format of documents in both the collections.

The _mongodb-docs-embedded_ collection chunked versions of documents in the _mongodb-docs_ collection, and hence has a higher document count.
