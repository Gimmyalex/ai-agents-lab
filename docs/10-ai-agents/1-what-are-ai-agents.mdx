An AI agent is a system that uses an LLM to **reason** through a problem, create a **plan** to solve the problem, and **execute** the plan with the help of a set of tools.

In agentic systems, one or multiple LLMs go through multiple iterations of reasoning and action-taking to reach the final answer to a user question. This means agents can handle complex, multi-step queries, and also self-revise and refine responses.
