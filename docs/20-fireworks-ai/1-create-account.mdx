# üëê Create an account

In this lab, we will be using _FireFunction V1_, a free and open-source function calling model from Fireworks AI.

The easiest way to use this model is via the Fireworks API. But first, you will need to create a Fireworks account. **If you already have an account, you can move on to the next section.**

Start by navigating to to the [Fireworks AI homepage](https://fireworks.ai/) and click the purple **Get Started Free** button to create an account.

Click **Login With Google** and authenticate with your Google account. This will provision a new Fireworks account for you.
