# 👐 Instantiate chat completion LLM

Let's instantiate the chat completion LLM to use as the "brain" of our agent and for any of the tools if required.

We will use Fireworks AI's free AND open-source **firefunction-v1** model via the **ChatFireworks** API in LangChain.

Fill in `<CODE_BLOCK_7>` under "Step 4: Instantiate Chat Completion LLM" and run the cell containing the code block.

👐 **CODE_BLOCK_7**: Create an instance of `ChatFireworks` with the model `firefunction-v1`, temperature set to `0.0` and max tokens set to `1024`
