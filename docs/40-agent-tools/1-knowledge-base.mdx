# 👐 Create the agent's knowledge base

One of the tools that the AI research agent has access to is a question-answering tool for the agent to answer questions based on information in its knowledge base. But first, we need to create the knowledge base.

## Download the dataset from Hugging Face

We will use a dataset consisting of a subset of Arxiv papers, to build our knowledge base. The data is available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mongodb-eai/arxiv-embeddings).

👐 Run the first **TWO** cells under "Step 3: Ingest Data into MongoDB Atlas" to download the dataset from Hugging Face and preview it.

Notice that the dataset already has an `embedding` column, which consists of embeddings of the paper abstracts.

## Ingest data into MongoDB Atlas

Let's use the **PyMongo** Python library to ingest data into MongoDB Atlas. Fill in `<CODE_BLOCK_3>` to `<CODE_BLOCK_6>` and run the cells containing these code blocks.

👐 **CODE_BLOCK_3**: Initialize a MongoDB Python client

<div>
```python
MongoClient(MONGODB_URI)
```
</div>
</details>

👐 **CODE_BLOCK_4**: Connect to the `COLLECTION_NAME` collection using the MongoDB client

📚 https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html#getting-a-collection

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>
```python
client[DB_NAME][COLLECTION_NAME]
```
</div>
</details>

👐 **CODE_BLOCK_5**: Bulk delete all existing records from the `collection` collection -- should be a one-liner

📚 https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/pymongo/collection.html

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>
```python
collection.delete_many({})
```
</div>
</details>

👐 **CODE_BLOCK_6**: Bulk insert `records` into the `collection` collection -- should be a one-liner

📚 https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/pymongo/collection.html

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>
```python
collection.insert_many(records)
```
</div>
