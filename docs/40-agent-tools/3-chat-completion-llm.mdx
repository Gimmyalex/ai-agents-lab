# üëê Instantiate chat completion LLM

Let's instantiate the chat completion LLM to use as the "brain" of our agent and for any of the tools if required.

We will use Fireworks AI's free AND open-source _firefunction-v1_ model via the _ChatFireworks_ API in LangChain.

Fill in any `<CODE_BLOCK>`s and run the cells under the **Step 5: Instantiate chat completion LLM** section in the notebook to create an instance of _ChatFireworks_ with the _firefunction-v1_ model.

The answers for code blocks in this section are as follows:

**CODE_BLOCK_7**
