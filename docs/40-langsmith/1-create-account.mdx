In this lab, we will use LangChain to build an AI research agent.

LangSmith is a platform that can help visualize the series of steps taken by an LLM application built using LangChain, to go from input to output. You can use LangSmith during the lab for debugging.

To use LangSmith, you will first need to create an account.
