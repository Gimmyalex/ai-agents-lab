# üëê Create the agent's knowledge base

One of the tools that the AI research agent has access to is a question-answering tool that retrieves information from a knowledge base (MongoDB collection) and uses it to answer questions. But first, we need to create the knowledge base.

Fill in any `<CODE_BLOCK>`s and run the cells under the **Step 3: Create a knowledge base** section in the notebook to download a dataset of Arxiv papers from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mongodb-eai/arxiv-embeddings) and ingest it into a MongoDB collection which will serve as our agent's knowledge base.

The answers for code blocks in this section are as follows:

**CODE_BLOCK_3**

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>
```python
MongoClient(MONGODB_URI)
```
</div>
</details>

**CODE_BLOCK_4**

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>
```python
client[DB_NAME][COLLECTION_NAME]
```
</div>
</details>

**CODE_BLOCK_5**

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>
```python
collection.delete_many({})
```
